from AMD and Intel to overcome the tradeoff to simultaneously achieve a
high level of security and high performance. We present TrustVisor, a
special-purpose hypervisor that provides code integrity as well as data
integrity and secrecy for selected portions of an application.
TrustVisor achieves a high level of security, ﬁrst because it can
protect sensitive code at a very ﬁne granularity, and second because it
has a very small code base (only around 6K lines of code) that makes
veriﬁcation feasible. TrustVisor can also attest the existence of
isolated execution to an external entity. We have implemented TrustVisor
to protect security-sensitive code blocks while imposing less than 7\%
overhead on the legacy OS and its applications in the common case. },

  abstract = {Protecting commodity operating systems against software
exploits is known to be challenging, because of their sheer size. The
same goes for key software applications such as web browsers or mail
clients. As a consequence, a significant fraction of internet-connected
computers is infected with malware.

To mitigate this threat, we propose a combined approach of (1) a
run-time security architecture that can efficiently protect fine-grained
software modules executing on a standard operating system, and (2) a
compiler that compiles standard C source code modules to such protected
binary modules.

The offered security guarantees are significant: relying on a TCB of
only a few thousand lines of code, we show that the power of arbitrary
kernel-level or process-level malware is reduced to interacting with the
module through the module's public API. With a proper API design and
implementation, modules are fully protected.

The run-time architecture can be loaded on demand and only incurs
performance overhead when it is loaded. Benchmarks show that, once
loaded, it incurs a 3.22% system-wide performance cost. For applications
that make intensive use of protected modules, and hence benefit most of
the security guarantees provided, the performance cost is up to 14%.},

current operating systems (OSs) have been increasing at an alarming
rate. Moreover, there is a direct correlation between vulnerability and
the size and complexity of the software base on a PC platform. Stealth
malware takes advantage of this complexity in the way it attacks PCs.
Recently, malware has been increasingly used for automated and targeted
attacks that steal user data from applications. Anti-virus software is
limited to wellknown signatures and does not address low-level rootkits
that subvert the OS and all the services that security software depends
on. In this article, we describe our research prototype, P-MAPS, a
processor-measured service layer that dynamically reduces the trusted
computing base (TCB) and verifiably improves the runtime security of
user’s applications, without interrupting the typical operation of the
user OS. We describe the P-MAPS architecture that was built using
current Intel processors. Our dynamic usage approach reduces the
execution footprint of P-MAPS, making it feasible to protect critical
applications on power-sensitive mobile platforms. We also discuss some
security usages that can benefit from P-MAPS.},

We assume correctness of compiler, assembly code, and hardware, and we used a unique design approach that fuses formal andoperating systems techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first formal proof of functional correctness of a complete, general-purpose operating-system kernel. Functional correctnessmeans here that the implementation always strictly follows our high-level abstract specification of kernel behaviour. This encompasses traditional design and implementation safety properties such as the kernel will never crash, and it will never perform an unsafe operation. It also proves much more: we can predict precisely how the kernel will behave in every possible situation.seL4, a third-generation microkernel of L4 provenance, comprises 8,700 lines of C code and 600 lines of assembler. Its performance is comparable to other high-performance L4 kernels.}},

Malware is often designed to immediately disable any security tools upon installation, rendering them useless. While current research has focused on moving these vulnerable security tools into an isolated virtual machine, this approach cripples security tools by preventing them from doing active monitoring. This paper describes an architecture that takes a hybrid approach, giving security tools the ability to do active monitoring while still benefiting from the increased security of an isolated virtual machine. We discuss the architecture and a prototype implementation that can process hooks from a virtual machine running Windows XP on Xen. We conclude with a security analysis and show the performance of a single hook to be 28 musecs in the best case.}},

A monitoring technique known as introspection has received significant discussion in the research literature, but these prior works have focused on the applications of introspection rather than how to properly build a monitoring architecture. In this paper we propose a set of requirements that should guide the development of virtual machine monitoring solutions. To illustrate the viability of these requirements, we describe the design of XenAccess, a monitoring library for operating systems running on Xen. XenAccess incorporates virtual memory introspection and virtual disk monitoring capabilities, allowing monitor applications to safely and efficiently access the memory state and disk activity of a target operating system. XenAccess' efficiency and functionality are illustrated through a series of performance tests and practical examples.}},

Our countermeasure does not rely on secret values (such as canaries) and protects against attacks that are not addressed by state-of-the-art countermeasures. Our technique splits the standard stack into multiple stacks. The allocation of data types to one of the stacks is based on the chances that a specific data element is either a target of attacks and/or an attack vector. We have implemented our solution in a C-compiler for Linux. The evaluation shows that the overhead of using our countermeasure is negligible},

	abstract = {Bugs in dynamic memory management, including for instance heap-based buffer overflows and dangling pointers, are an important source of vulnerabilities in C and C++. Overwriting the management information of the memory allocation library is often a source of attack on these vulnerabilities. All existing countermeasures with low performance overhead rely on magic values or canaries. A secret value is placed before a crucial memory location and by monitoring whether the value has changed, overruns can be detected. Hence, if attackers are able to read arbitrary memory locations, they can bypass the countermeasure. In this paper we present an approach that, when applied to a memory allocator, will protect against this attack vector without resorting to magic. We implemented our approach by modifying an existing widely-used memory allocator. Benchmarks show that this implementation has a negligible, sometimes even beneficial, impact on performance.},

Our countermeasure does not rely on secret values (such as canaries) and protects against attacks that are not addressed by state-of-the-art countermeasures. Our technique splits the standard stack into multiple stacks. The allocation of data types to one of the stacks is based on the chances that a specific data element is either a target of attacks and/or an attack vector. We have implemented our solution in a C-compiler for Linux. The evaluation shows that the overhead of using our countermeasure is negligible},

	abstract = {Bugs in dynamic memory management, including for instance heap-based buffer overflows and dangling pointers, are an important source of vulnerabilities in C and C++. Overwriting the management information of the memory allocation library is often a source of attack on these vulnerabilities. All existing countermeasures with low performance overhead rely on magic values or canaries. A secret value is placed before a crucial memory location and by monitoring whether the value has changed, overruns can be detected. Hence, if attackers are able to read arbitrary memory locations, they can bypass the countermeasure. In this paper we present an approach that, when applied to a memory allocator, will protect against this attack vector without resorting to magic. We implemented our approach by modifying an existing widely-used memory allocator. Benchmarks show that this implementation has a negligible, sometimes even beneficial, impact on performance.},
